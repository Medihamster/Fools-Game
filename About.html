		<h1>About Me</h1> 

		<p>
		Hi there! I'm known around the internet as <strong>tigeatoray</strong>.
		I love video games (especially Nintendo games), drawing, sleeping and eating.</p>
		<p>
		My artwork can be found in various locations, but I'm most active on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/_tigeatoray_/">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Tigeatoray">YouTube</a>.
		</p>
		<p>I currently work full time as a software developer, which doesn't give me much time to work on 
			Fool's Game. Regardless, I appreciate you taking the time to check out this project. ^_^
