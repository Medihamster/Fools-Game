		Hi there! I'm known around the internet as <strong>tigeatoray</strong>. I'm currently enrolled in software engineering somewhere off in the distance, and I love to draw and create stories. </p>
		<p>
		My artwork can be found in various locations, including:
		<ul class = "secondary"> 
			<li> <a href="http://www.tigeatoray.deviantart.com"> DeviantArt </a> </li>
			<li> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/_tigeatoray_/"> Instagram </a> </li>
			<li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Tigeatoray"> YouTube </a> </li>
			<li> <a href="http://colorslive.com/author?id=164666">  Colors!3D </a> </li>
		<!--	<li> <a href="https://miiverse.nintendo.net/users/Tigeatoray/posts"> Miiverse </a></li> -->

		</ul>
		</p>

		<p> I'm not ready to publish Fool's Game just yet because I know I have a long way to go with my art. I'm nowhere near where I want to be. Hopefully it'll be done in about 25 years! That's the plan, at least. As a university student, I don't have enough time to work on it right now '^^ </p>

		<p> This was a very fun coding project for me to try out html and css!! :D Time to try out Javascript. Eventually... </p>
		
		<p>Also, I now understand why there are so many simple websites out there that look so simple and similar to each other. You know, like those history websites with the ugly green backgrounds. I hope this website doesn't remind you of those. :)
