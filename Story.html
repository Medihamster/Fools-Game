	<p class = "character"> There exists a stone called <strong>Stilenite</strong>, known to a small number of people around the world. Though it has the ability to grant unique skills to a handful of individuals,  most of its potential users are unaware of its inexplicable power. This includes Zed Tsine, a 19 year old who lives alone with his younger sister. With his father in jail and his mother under supervision for her health, he is destined to spend the rest of his life working to provide for his family.
		<br> <br>
		... Or so he thought. 
		<br> <br>
		Dragged into a desperate search for Stilenite by a rich and manipulative student from his high school, Zed works with four other Stilenite users to obtain as much of the stone as possible.
